  In this work, we leverage nanoscale imaging by designing and implementing a metalens to record two incident polarizations under the same viewpoint and show that we can use polarimetry to solve for the surface details of the captured object. We achieve this by, first, simulating a polarization-sensitive bifocal metalens enabling us to record and verify the far-field profiles of cross and parallel polarized incident illumination under the same viewpoint so that they are resolved separately, as two focus peaks, on the same focal plane but with a small distance between them. We then record the designed metalens’s response to an object lit by this polarized incident illumination to infer the diffuse and specular properties of the surface, thereby allowing us to capture material properties with a nanoscale system as well as deriving more information from the designed imaging system in a single shot.
